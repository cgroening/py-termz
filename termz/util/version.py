def get_version(

) -> str:
    """
    Returns the version string for the given package.

    Tries `importlib.metadata` first (installed packages), then falls back
    to reading `pyproject.toml` - useful during development when the package
    is not installed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    package_name : str
        The distribution name of the package (as in pyproject.toml).
    pyproject_toml_parent_path : Path, optional
        Path of the folder that contains project's `pyproject.toml`.
        Required when the package is not installed and the fallback is needed.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        The version string (e.g. `0.1.0`).

    Raises
    ------
    FileNotFoundError
        If the metadata is unavailable and no `pyproject.toml` was provided
        or found at the given path.
    KeyError
        If `pyproject.toml` exists but contains no `[project] version`.
